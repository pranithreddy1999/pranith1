    <p1>Social and personal activities are significantly affected by poor sleep.<br>
         There are different types of sleep disorders and it is costing us at different levels.<br>
          As shows that only in Australia sleep disorder costs the economy around $5.1 billion per year that comprises health care,<br>
          associated medical conditions, productivity, and non-medical costs. And among all sleep disorder, OSA is the most common cause .<br>
          Normally during sleep, our upper airway remain open due to relaxed but strong enough muscles,<br>
           lining the upper throat. But in OSA, someone can have a recurring blockage in upper airway due to different reasons,<br>
            for more than 10 sec for each blockage, which causes the lungs out of oxygen and person to wake,<br>
             which will restore the airway. If more than 15 apneas occur then the diagnosis of OSA is made. History of the patient,<br>
              physical examination, polysomnography (PSG) test, and imaging are being used to diagnose OSA. The gold standard to diagnoses is PSG test.<br>
               In which a person needs to sleep in a unit in a hospital with some sensors to monitor breathing patterns, Oxygen level, heart rate, and body movements.<br>
                Social and personal activities are significantly affected by poor sleep.

        1.1 Purpose
        Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder characterized by repeated episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep,<br>
         leading to disrupted breathing patterns. Early detection and accurate prediction of OSA are crucial for effective treatment and prevention of associated health risks.<br>
          This project aims to explore the use of deep learning techniques, specifically facial depth maps, for predicting OSA.
        
        1.2 Scope
        The task of predicting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using deep learning models is an active area of research. <br>
        While facial depth maps have been explored in various computer vision applications, their specific use for OSA prediction is not well-documented.<br>
         However, I can provide you with some general information on OSA prediction using deep learning techniques.
